A single repository containing my unique AI application projects.
Each project lives in its own folder and is production‑minded from day one.

## Projects
- **registration-bot/** — CLI KYC/registration assistant (OpenAI API, validation, summary).

## How I work
- Each project has its own `README.md` and `requirements.txt`.
- Commits are small and descriptive.
- Secrets live in `.env` and are never committed.
